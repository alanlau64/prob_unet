## A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images

Hantian Liu, Jiacheng Gao, Zhicheng Dong

This is an implementation of [probabilistic U-Net](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05034.pdf).

We implemented model structure and some preprocessing of cityscape currently. 
Now we can train the model with images from LIDC dataset with ```main.py```
with default parameters.
